    <p>
      Call of Duty is a video game series and media franchise published by
      Activision, starting in 2003. The games were first developed by Infinity
      Ward then by Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games. Several spin-off and
      handheld games were made by other developers. The most recent title, Call
      of Duty: Modern Warfare II, was released on October 28, 2022. The series
      originally focused on the World War II with Infinity Ward developing Call
      of Duty (2003) and Call of Duty 2 (2005) titles in the series and Treyarch
      developing the Call of Duty 3 (2006). Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare
      (2007) introduced a modern setting, and proved to be the breakthrough
      title for the series, creating the Modern Warfare sub-series; a Modern
      Warfare remastered version released in 2016. Two other entries, Modern
      Warfare 2 (2009) and Modern Warfare 3 (2011), were made. The sub-series
      received a reboot with Modern Warfare in 2019, with Call of Duty: Modern
      Warfare II released in 2022. Infinity Ward have also developed two games
      outside of the Modern Warfare sub-series, Ghosts (2013) and Infinite
      Warfare (2016). Treyarch made one last World War II-based game, World at
      War (2008), before releasing Black Ops (2010) and subsequently creating
      the Black Ops sub-series. Four other entries, Black Ops II (2012), Black
      Ops III (2015), Black Ops 4 (2018), and Cold War (2020) were made, the
      latter in conjunction with Raven Software. Sledgehammer Games, who were
      co-developers for Modern Warfare 3, have also developed three titles,
      Advanced Warfare (2014), Call of Duty: WWII (2017), and Vanguard (2021).
      As of April 2021, the series has sold over 400 million copies.[1]
      Meanwhile, the games in the series have consistently released annually to
      blockbuster-level sales, the series is verified by the Guinness World
      Records as the best-selling first-person shooter game series. It is also
      the most successful video game franchise created in the United States and
      the fourth best-selling video game franchise of all time. Other products
      in the franchise include a line of action figures designed by Plan B Toys,
      a card game created by Upper Deck Company, Mega Bloks sets by Mega Brands,
      and a comic book miniseries published by WildStorm Productions, and a
      feature film in development.
